# AWS and Cloud Computing

## What is cloud computing?

Cloud computing is **on-demand access**, via the internet, **to computing resources**—applications, servers (physical servers and virtual servers), data storage, development tools, networking capabilities, and more—hosted at a remote data center managed by a cloud services provider (or CSP). The CSP makes these resources available for a monthly subscription fee or bills them according to usage.

## Quick history of cloud computing

Cloud computing has its roots in the concept of utility computing, which dates back to the 1960s. However, the modern concept of cloud computing emerged in the late 1990s, with the introduction of Salesforce.com's web-based sales automation software. The term "cloud computing" was coined in the early 2000s, and the concept gained momentum as internet bandwidth and infrastructure improved. Amazon Web Services (AWS) launched in 2006, followed by Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure in 2008 and 2010 respectively. Since then, cloud computing has become a ubiquitous technology, with businesses and individuals relying on cloud services for everything from file storage to application hosting. Today, cloud computing has become an integral part of modern business and is used for a variety of purposes, including hosting websites, storing and processing data, and running applications

## Quick history of AWS

Amazon Web Services (AWS) was launched by Amazon.com in 2006, after the company realized the potential of selling its infrastructure as a service (IaaS). The first service offered was Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS), which is a fully managed message queuing service that enables distributed application components to communicate with each other. AWS was initially designed to provide a platform for hosting web applications, but has since expanded to provide a wide range of services, including computing, storage, database, analytics, machine learning, and more. Today, AWS is one of the leading cloud service providers in the world, with millions of customers across a variety of industries.

## What is IaaS, PaaS and SaaS? Make a diagram please.

- **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**: IaaS contains the basic building blocks for cloud IT. It typically provides access to networking features, computers (virtual or on dedicated hardware), and data storage space. IaaS gives you the highest level of flexibility and management control over your IT resources. It is most similar to the existing IT resources with which many IT departments and developers are familiar. 
- **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**: PaaS removes the need for you to manage underlying infrastructure (usually hardware and operating systems), and allows you to focus on the deployment and management of your applications. This helps you be more efficient as you don’t need to worry about resource procurement, capacity planning, software maintenance, patching, or any of the other undifferentiated heavy lifting involved in running your application. 
- **Software as a Service (SaaS)**: SaaS provides you with a complete product that is run and managed by the service provider. In most cases, people referring to SaaS are referring to end-user applications (such as web-based email). With a SaaS offering, you don’t have to think about how the service is maintained or how the underlying infrastructure is managed. You only need to think about how you will use that particular software.

## What is the difference between public cloud, hybrid cloud and private cloud?

The three primary cloud deployment models:

Public cloud: Public cloud refers to a cloud computing model in which services are delivered over the internet by third-party cloud service providers such as AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure. The infrastructure is shared by multiple organizations and the cloud provider manages the hardware, software, and other infrastructure components.

Private cloud: Private cloud refers to a cloud infrastructure that is solely dedicated to one organization. Private clouds can be located on-premises or can be hosted by a third-party service provider. Private clouds provide greater control and security, but also require more management and maintenance.

Hybrid cloud: Hybrid cloud is a combination of public and private cloud models. It allows organizations to maintain a private cloud for sensitive data and applications while using public cloud services for other non-sensitive workloads. Hybrid clouds offer the benefits of both public and private clouds, but can be more complex to manage.

In summary, public cloud is the most widely used deployment model, private cloud provides greater control and security, while hybrid cloud combines the benefits of both models.

## What types of industry/business use the different types of cloud? (e.g. who uses a private cloud?)

Public cloud: Public cloud is best suited for businesses that have variable demands and want to scale their infrastructure quickly. This type of cloud computing is suitable for startups, small businesses, and companies that need to host non-critical applications or services. Examples of public cloud providers include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform.

Private cloud: Private cloud is ideal for organizations that require complete control over their data and infrastructure. This type of cloud computing is used by government agencies, financial institutions, and healthcare organizations that have strict compliance and security requirements. Private clouds can be hosted on-premises or by a third-party provider.

Hybrid cloud: Hybrid cloud is a combination of public and private cloud infrastructure. It is suitable for businesses that have workloads that require high performance, security, and compliance. Hybrid cloud is often used by large enterprises that need to manage complex workloads that span multiple environments. It provides the flexibility to move workloads between public and private clouds as needed.

In summary, the choice of cloud computing model depends on factors such as workload requirements, compliance and security needs, and business objectives.

## What is Operating expenditure (OpEx) and What is Capital expenditure (CapEx)?

Operating expenditure (OpEx) refers to the day-to-day expenses incurred by a business to maintain its operations, such as salaries, rent, utilities, and other recurring expenses. OpEx is usually considered as a regular and ongoing expense for the business.

Capital expenditure (CapEx), on the other hand, refers to the funds spent by a business on acquiring or upgrading fixed assets, such as buildings, equipment, and machinery. CapEx is usually a one-time expense and is meant to generate long-term benefits for the business.

In short, OpEx is the money spent to keep the business running, while CapEx is the money spent to grow and improve the business.

## Which is preferable and how does the cloud allow businesses to transfer to spending more on the preferred one?

Both operating expenditure (OpEx) and capital expenditure (CapEx) have their advantages and disadvantages, depending on the needs and goals of a business.

CapEx refers to spending on physical assets such as buildings, equipment, and infrastructure that will be used over a long period of time. These investments are usually made upfront, and the costs are spread out over the asset's useful life through depreciation. CapEx is generally preferred when a business has a stable and predictable demand for its products or services and wants to control its assets to reduce costs in the long term.

OpEx, on the other hand, refers to the ongoing operational costs of a business, such as employee salaries, utility bills, and cloud service subscriptions. OpEx is generally preferred when a business has unpredictable or fluctuating demand, as it allows for greater flexibility and agility in adapting to changes in the market.

The cloud allows businesses to transfer from CapEx to OpEx spending by offering a pay-as-you-go pricing model. Instead of investing in physical infrastructure, businesses can rent computing resources, storage, and other services from cloud providers on an as-needed basis, paying only for what they use. This allows businesses to avoid the upfront costs and ongoing maintenance associated with physical assets, and to scale up or down quickly in response to changes in demand. The cloud also provides businesses with greater access to advanced technologies and services that would otherwise be prohibitively expensive to implement in-house.
