## What is S3? <a id="what-is-s3?">What is S3?</a>

Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is a scalable, secure, and highly durable object storage service, offering industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. It is designed to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web. S3 is commonly used as a storage backend for various applications, and it offers a simple web services interface that allows developers to easily integrate it into their applications.
Storage = buckets. Objects = files in buckets.
It is reliable, secure and durable as it has multiple copies of the same data so that it will not be lost.
(Free to get files in the same region.)

## Use cases <a id="use-cases">Use cases</a>

Here are some of the common use cases for AWS S3:

- Data Backup and Recovery: S3 is often used as a backup solution for enterprises and individuals. It provides a reliable and cost-effective way to store backups of critical data. S3's durability and redundancy features ensure that your data is protected against hardware failures and can be easily restored when needed.

- Static Website Hosting: S3 can be used to host static websites. You can store HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other web assets in S3 buckets and configure them for static website hosting. S3 integrates with Amazon CloudFront, a content delivery network (CDN), to deliver the website content globally with low latency.

- Data Archiving: S3's cost-effective storage options make it suitable for long-term data archiving. You can store infrequently accessed data, such as log files, historical records, or regulatory compliance data, in S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive. These storage classes provide low-cost archival storage with retrieval options optimized for long-term retention.

- Content Distribution: S3 integrates seamlessly with Amazon CloudFront, allowing you to distribute your content globally with low latency and high data transfer speeds. This is especially useful for delivering large files, such as media files, software downloads, or game assets, to users around the world.

- Data Lakes and Analytics: S3 is often used as a data lake, where organizations can store large amounts of structured and unstructured data for analytics purposes. Data can be directly ingested into S3 from various sources, and analytics services like Amazon Athena, Amazon Redshift, or Apache Spark can process and analyze the data stored in S3.

- Application Data Storage: S3 can be used as a primary data store for applications. It provides a reliable and scalable storage solution for various types of data, including user files, documents, images, videos, and more. Many applications leverage S3's features for storing and retrieving user-generated content.

- Disaster Recovery: S3 can be used as part of a disaster recovery strategy. By replicating data across multiple regions or using cross-region replication, organizations can ensure that their data is protected and available in case of a regional outage or disaster.

## S3 provides High Availability <a id=s3-provides-high-availability>S3 provides High Availability</a>

By leveraging the following mechanisms, AWS S3 provides a highly available and reliable storage solution for storing and accessing your data in the cloud.

- Data Replication: AWS S3 automatically replicates data across multiple devices and multiple facilities within a region. This replication ensures that even if one device or facility fails, your data remains accessible from alternative storage locations. S3 uses a technique called "cross-region replication" to replicate data across different regions, providing additional redundancy and disaster recovery capabilities.
- Redundancy: S3 stores multiple copies of your data within a single region by default. Each object is redundantly stored across different servers and multiple storage devices, which helps protect against hardware failures. The redundancy ensures that if one server or device fails, your data remains available from another server or device.
- Regional Availability: AWS S3 is designed to be highly available within an AWS region. Regions are composed of multiple availability zones (AZs), which are physically separate data centers. S3 stores data across multiple AZs within a region, ensuring that your data remains accessible even if an entire AZ becomes unavailable.
- Scalability: S3 is designed to scale automatically to accommodate increased demand and storage requirements. It can handle high levels of request traffic and automatically distribute the load across multiple servers. This ensures that your applications can continue to access data stored in S3 without interruption, even during periods of high demand.
- Service Level Agreement (SLA): AWS provides a service level agreement for S3, which guarantees a certain level of availability. The SLA typically promises 99.99% availability for S3 within a region. This means that S3 is designed to be highly reliable and accessible, and AWS takes responsibility for maintaining its availability.
- Durability: S3 offers high durability, meaning that your data is designed to be highly protected against data loss. S3 achieves this by automatically storing multiple copies of your data across different devices and facilities, as mentioned earlier. The durability level of S3 is extremely high, with AWS guaranteeing 99.999999999% (11 nines) durability for S3 objects.

## CLI can be used to: <a id=cli-can-be-used-to>CLI can be used to:</a>

**C** - Create,
**R** - Read,
**U** - Update,
**D** - Delete

### Install AWS CLI <a id=install-aws-cli>Install AWS CLI</a>

CLI = Command Line Interface
1. Open terminal in PyCharm.
2. `cd` to directory you want as bucket
3. `pip install awscli`

### Log in with Access Key <a id=log-in-with-access-key>Log in with Access Key</a>

1. `aws configure`
2. Enter Access Key. Just Enter if you have already input.
3. Enter Secret Access Key. Just Enter if you have already input.
4. Enter region name as 'eu-west-1'. Just Enter if you have already input.
5. output format: json. Just Enter if you have already input.

Check if the log in succeeded: `aws s3 ls`, which should return a list of the available buckets.

Note all CLI commands are using 'tech230-esther-bucket' as the bucket name, 'sampletext.txt' is the file that we move/delete to/from bucket.

### Create a bucket <a id=create-a-bucket>Create a bucket</a>

To create a bucket use `aws s3 mb s3://tech230-esther-bucket`, returns 'make_bucket: tech230-esther-bucket'.

### Upload to bucket <a id=upload-to-bucket>Upload to bucket</a>

To upload a file to a bucket use `aws s3 cp sampletext.txt s3://tech230-esther-bucket` (specify the path to the file if not in folder where 'sampletext.txt' is; 'cp' = copy), returns 'upload: .\sampletext.txt to s3://tech230-esther-bucket/sampletext.txt'.

### Read from bucket <a id=read-from-bucket>Read from bucket</a>

To download a file use `aws s3 sync s3://tech230-luke-bucket s3-downloads`, returns 'download: s3://tech230-luke-bucket/sampletext.txt to s3-downloads\sampletext.txt', after which you can navigate to the specified directory ('s3-downloads'), which contains the downloaded files.

### Delete a bucket <a id=delete-a-bucket>Delete a bucket</a>

Note that you cannot delete a bucket if it is not empty.

Remove an individual file with `aws s3 rm s3://tech230-esther-bucket/sampletext.txt`, returns 'delete: s3://tech230-esther-bucket/sampletext.txt'.

*_Caution_*: Remove everything from a bucket: `aws s3 rm s3://tech230-esther-bucket --recursive`.

Delete bucket: `aws s3 rb s3://tech230-esther-bucket`, returns 'remove_bucket: tech230-esther-bucket'.
