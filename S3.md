# S3 - Simple Secure Storage

Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service offering industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance.
Storage = buckets.
It has multiple copies of the same data so that it will not be lost.
Free to get files in the same region.

## CLI can be used to:

**C** - Create,
**R** - Read,
**U** - Update,
**D** - Delete

### Install AWS CLI

CLI = Command Line Interface
1. Open terminal in PyCharm.
2. `cd` to directory you want as bucket
3. `pip install awscli`

### Log in with Access Key

1. `aws configure`
2. Enter Access Key. Just Enter if you have already input.
3. Enter Secret Access Key. Just Enter if you have already input.
4. Enter region name as 'eu-west-1'. Just Enter if you have already input.
5. output format: json. Just Enter if you have already input.

Check if the log in succeeded: `aws s3 ls`, which should return a list of the available buckets.

Note all CLI commands are using 'tech230-esther-bucket' as the bucket name, 'sampletext.txt' is the file that we move/delete to/from bucket.

### Create a bucket

To create a bucket use `aws s3 mb s3://tech230-esther-bucket --region eu-west-1`, returns 'make_bucket: tech230-esther-bucket'.

### Upload to bucket

To upload a file to a bucket use `aws s3 cp sampletext.txt s3://tech230-esther-bucket` (specify the path to the file if not in folder where 'sampletext.txt' is; 'cp' = copy), returns 'upload: .\sampletext.txt to s3://tech230-esther-bucket/sampletext.txt'.

### Read from bucket

To download a file use `aws s3 sync s3://tech230-luke-bucket s3-downloads`, returns 'download: s3://tech230-luke-bucket/sampletext.txt to s3-downloads\sampletext.txt', after which you can navigate to the specified directory ('s3-downloads'), which contains the downloaded files.

### Delete a bucket

Note that you cannot delete a bucket if it is not empty.

Remove an individual file with `aws s3 rm s3://tech230-esther-bucket/sampletext.txt`, returns 'delete: s3://tech230-esther-bucket/sampletext.txt'.

*_Caution_*: Remove everything from a bucket: `aws s3 rm s3://tech230-esther-bucket --recursive`.

Delete bucket: `aws s3 rb s3://tech230-esther-bucket`, returns 'remove_bucket: tech230-esther-bucket'.

## Python CRUD:

Install boto3 python library with `pip install boto3`.
[AWS - boto3 client vs resource](https://www.learnaws.org/2021/02/24/boto3-resource-client/), [AWS - boto3](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/quickstart.html)

To see all buckets:
```python
import boto3
# connect to s3
s3 = boto3.resource("s3")
# lists buckets
for bucket in s3.buckets.all():
  print(bucket.name)
```

### Create bucket

```python
import boto3
# connect to s3
s3 = boto3.client("s3")
# create a bucket on s3
bucket_name = s3.create_bucket(Bucket = "tech230-esther-boto", CreateBucketConfiguration={"LocationConstraint": "eu-west-1"})
```
### Update bucket

```python
import boto3
# connect to s3
s3 = boto3.resource("s3")
# open the file we want to send, stores it in a variable called data
data = open("sampletext.txt", "rb")
# specify what bucket we are sending the file to, .put_object names the file and sends its' contents
s3.Bucket("tech230-esther-boto").put_object(Key="sampletext.txt", Body=data)
```
### Read bucket

```python
import boto3
# connection to s3
s3 = boto3.client("s3")
# downloads from s3 bucket
s3.download_file("tech230-esther-boto", "sampletext.txt", "sampletext1.txt")
```
### Delete bucket

```python
import boto3
# connect to s3
s3 = boto3.resource("s3")
# bucket variable
bucket = s3.Bucket("tech230-esther-boto")
# deletes bucket
response = bucket.delete()
```

### Delete a file from a bucket

```python
import boto3
# connect to s3
s3 = boto3.resource("s3")
# delete a file in a particular bucket
s3.Object("tech230-esther-boto","sampletext.txt").delete()
```
